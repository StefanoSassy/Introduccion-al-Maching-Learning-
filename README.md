# Introduction to Machine Learning: Linear Programming

This repository contains an introductory class to machine learning, with a focus on linear programming. The class covers various concepts such as correlation matrices, linear regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). It includes theoretical explanations and practical examples using Python to apply the concepts.

## Repository Outline:
1. **Boston Dataset**: Introduction to the Boston housing dataset, used to demonstrate the correlation matrix and regression techniques.
2. **Correlation Matrix**: The theory behind the construction of the correlation matrix is presented, followed by Python code to generate and interpret it.
3. **Least Squares Theory**: An explanation of the least squares method and how it is applied in linear regression to minimize error.
4. **Linear Regression**: The implementation of linear regression using Python's regression algorithm, comparing the predictive model using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric.
5. **SVM (Support Vector Machines)**: Introduction to SVM, using the `make_circles` example to demonstrate classification with a non-linear decision boundary.
6. **Visualization**: A discussion on how to visualize the results of both the linear regression and SVM models using Python's plotting libraries.

## How It Works:
- The class starts by exploring the Boston housing dataset, applying linear regression to make predictions and evaluating the model's performance using MSE.
- The correlation matrix is calculated and used to understand relationships between features in the dataset.
- Linear regression is then applied using Pythonâ€™s built-in tools, followed by the comparison of the results with SVM classification on the `make_circles` dataset.
- Finally, both models are visualized using popular Python libraries for plotting, providing insight into their performance.

## Features:
- **Linear Regression**: Includes a hands-on implementation of linear regression with theory on least squares and MSE.
- **SVM**: Introduction to Support Vector Machines using an example of `make_circles` and non-linear decision boundaries.
- **Visualization**: Code to plot and visualize the models' results, helping to understand the performance of both regression and classification models.
- **Theory and Code**: Theoretical explanations accompany Python code examples to give a deeper understanding of the concepts.

## Objective:
The goal of this repository is to provide an accessible introduction to key machine learning concepts, particularly linear programming, regression, and classification. It aims to equip learners with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed to get started with machine learning using Python.
